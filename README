App-Packager
============

App::Packager provides an abstract interface to a number of common
packagers, trying to catch as much common behaviour as possible.

The main purpose is to have uniform access to application specific
resources.

Supported packagers are PAR::Packer, Cava::Packager and unpackaged. In the
latter case, the packager functions are emulated via Cava::Packager which
provides fallback for unpackaged use.

For example:

    use App::Packager qw( :name My::App );
    print "My packager is: ", App::Packager::Packager(), "\n";
    print getresource("README.txt");
